= Introduction
*SendFromManyToMany (SFMTM)* is a new OP transaction type that can reduce the cost and time required to send OL smart property tokens and bitcoins from multiple
addresses to multiple addresses.footnote:[Technically, it probably should be called SendFromMultiToMulti, but that name might confuse people into thinking it's
only for use with multi-signature addresses.] One *SFMTM* transaction is intended to replace multiple OP *Simple Send* transactions. *SFMTM* can also be used to provide the bitcoins needed to send OL tokens and bitcoins from one or more addresses to one or more addresses.

= Motivation
*SFMTM* should be of benefit to cryptocurrency exchanges and also to OL wallet users. The flexibility, reduced cost and reduced time enabled by *SFMTM* should interest
both of those communities. OL Tokens and bitcoins can be sent from where they are rather than having to aggregate them in a "sending" address in order to send them as
a unit.

= Abstract
Conceptually, *SFMTM* is similar to using UTXOs from multiple addresses to send bitcoins to multiple addresses. Exchanges wonâ€™t have to
sweep OL tokens into a hot wallet from deposit addresses in order to send them out. That will reduce cost and time required for the exchanges to be able to send
the OL tokens and/or bitcoins to withdrawal addresses.

== General Transaction Structure
*SFMTM* inputs identify the addresses that own the OL tokens that will be sent. Those UTXOs specify the source of the bitcoin amounts that will
be sent to the recipient addresses. The order of the inputs doesn't matter. The whole available balance belonging to each input address will be moved from those addresses to one or
more recipient addresses.

*SFMTM* outputs identify the addresses that will receive the OL tokens according to the ordered list of amounts in OP_RETURN. The outputs will also specify
the amount of
bitcoins that will go to each address as a UTXO, as in any Bitcoin blockchain transaction. The last output address is the change address for the OL tokens. (This is open for discussion.) It receives
whatever tokens from the input addresses that weren't specifically sent to an output address.footnote:[The change address is necessary because the available
balance belonging to an input address may increase before the *SFMTM* is processed by OmniCore.]

OP_RETURN will contain:

* the "omni" identifier
* the *SFMTM* transaction type and version
* the OL smart property id of the tokens to be sent from the inputs to the outputs
* the ordered list of one or more amounts of the OL tokens to be sent to each corresponding output address, starting with the first output address.
** the list of amounts in OP_RETURN can be shorter than the list of outputs, if the transaction is also sending bitcoins but not OL tokens to one or more addresses

In order to save space, all the numeric values in OP_RETURN could be formatted as variable lenghth integers.

There are lots of error conditions to be checked and handled. If OmniCore detects _any_ OP-related error, no OL tokens are transfereed. The bitcoins would be transfered because the transaction is a valid bitcoin transaction.
