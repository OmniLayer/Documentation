= OLEs: Omni Layer Enhancement Proposals

== Introduction

This directory contains **O**mni **L**ayer **E**nhancement Proposals (**OLE**s) which are documents for proposing, discussing, and specifying ecosystem standards and additions to the Omni Protocol. OLEs are the Omni Layer equivalent of Bitcoin BIPs.
